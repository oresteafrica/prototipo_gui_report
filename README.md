DHIS2 will export aggregated data to Devinfo 7 ( http://www.devinfo.org )
It must be able to create report on district level, for levels up to the district, Devinfo will create reports based on aggregated data coming from DHIS2.
In order to do that, an interface able to extract data straight from DHIS2 Postgresql database is needed. While DHIS2 will be used for data entry, prototipo_gui_report will be used for generating reports on district level, exporting data to Devinfo and interoperation with Devinfo.
